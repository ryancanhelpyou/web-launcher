        h2 Advisory Board Member 
        h3 Marian Feldman
        p Marian Feldman holds a joint appointment in the Departments of the History of Art and Near Eastern Studies at Johns Hopkins University. She received her PhD in art history at Harvard University in ancient Near Eastern art and concentrates on the arts of the second and first millennia BCE in the Near East and Eastern Mediterranean. Her interests range from questions regarding the role of the arts in cultural interactions to issues of style, object agency, and materiality.
        p Feldman’s first book, Diplomacy by Design: Luxury Arts and an ‘International Style’ in the Ancient Near East, 1400–1200 BCE (Chicago 2006), investigates the role of artistic hybridity and luxury arts in international diplomacy during the Late Bronze Age. Her newest book, Communities of Style: Portable Luxury Arts, Identity and Collective Memory in the Iron Age Levant (Chicago 2014), examines the ways communities form around—and by means of—art objects, focusing on portable luxury items (in particular, ivory and metalwork) in the first half of the first millennium BCE. Feldman has also co-edited several volumes, including Critical Approaches to Ancient Near Eastern Art (with Brian A. Brown; De Gruyter 2013), and is the author of several articles and catalogue essays.
        p Feldman taught in the History of Art and Near Eastern Studies Departments at the University of California, Berkeley, before coming to Johns Hopkins in 2013.

        h3 Nachiket Chanchani
        p Nachiket Chanchani’s interests span many mediums, regions, and time periods. Currently, his research and writing about South Asian and Himalayan art, architecture, and visual culture has three main components: (1) investigating the expansion of sacred geographies, the movements of builders, and the creation of a mosaic of polities in the Central Himalayas and assessing how these activities intersected with stone temple construction and the development of sculptural form between the seventh and the twelfth century CE; (2) theorizing strategies to account for the production, dissemination, and performance of the linguistically hybrid and profusely painted scrolls and manuscripts of pre-Mughal western India; and (3) tracing the shadow of traditional Indian art, modern collections, and related scholarship on creative works of avant-garde Euro-American artists.
        p Chanchani’s recently published journal articles include “From Asoda to Almora: Maru-Gurjara Architecture in the Central Himalayas” in Arts Asiatiques 69 (2014), “The Jageshwar Valley, Where Death is Conquered” in Archives of Asian Art 63.2 (2013), and “The Camera Work of Ananda Coomaraswamy and Alfred Stieglitz” in History of Photography 37.2 (2013). He has held a postdoctoral fellowship at the Freer|Sackler and a Nehru Trust fellowship at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. He has also been involved with curatorial projects at the Philadelphia Museum of Art and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.
